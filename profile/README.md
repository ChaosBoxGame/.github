ChaosBox is a Half-Life 2 Sandbox mod that brings together a wide array of weapons and entities from other Source Engine games, such as Garry's Mod, Half-Life: Source, Portal, and more. Our goal is to create the ultimate sandbox experience on ModDB. Unlike many mods that rely on reused content like a Half-Life 2 Beta physics gun or a stolen spawn menu, ChaosBox features entirely original code written by our team.

Why ChaosBox?
<br>
ChaosBox sets itself apart by combining innovation, quality, and a commitment to originality. Weâ€™ve poured effort into ensuring that the mod isn't just another sandbox clone but a genuinely exciting and optimized experience.
